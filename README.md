# How to Prove You Had a Green Light Using ASTPM Data in Salt Lake City, Utah

If you're being blamed for a crash at an intersection but you had the green light, Utah’s **Advanced Signal Performance Metrics (ASTPM)** system may hold the proof you need. This guide shows how to pull signal phase data and read it accurately to verify that you had the right of way.

## What Is ASTPM?

ASTPM stands for **Advanced Signal Performance Metrics**, a traffic signal data collection system operated by the **Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT)**. It logs:

- Real-time and historical traffic signal phases
- Green, yellow, red intervals
- Split failures and phase terminations
- Time-of-day patterns

**Official ASTPM Access Point:**  
[https://udottraffic.utah.gov](https://udottraffic.utah.gov) → “Performance Metrics” → “ASTPM Portal”

## Step-by-Step: How to Prove You Had a Green Light

### Step 1: Confirm the Exact Intersection and Approach

Before accessing ASTPM, collect:
- Intersection name (e.g., 1300 E & 2100 S, Salt Lake City)
- Direction of your approach (e.g., NB, SB, EB, WB)
- Approximate time of crash (exact minute)

This allows pinpointing your movement phase.

---

### Step 2: Access the ASTPM Dashboard

1. Go to [https://udottraffic.utah.gov](https://udottraffic.utah.gov)
2. Select **“Performance Metrics”** from the top menu
3. Click on **“ASTPM Portal”**
   - You may be redirected to an Esri-based tool or UDOT's Traffop interface

---

### Step 3: Search for Your Intersection

- Use map view or filter by intersection name
- Choose the **Movement Phase** (your direction of travel and intended maneuver—e.g., Phase 2 = Northbound through)
- Select:
  - **Date and time range** (around the crash)
  - **Phase Termination or Phase Chart View**

---

### Step 4: Read the ASTPM Legend to Interpret Light Status

ASTPM uses standardized legends:

| Color         | Meaning                        |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| **Green bar** | Green light was active         |
| **Yellow bar**| Yellow interval                |
| **Red bar**   | Red light (approach must stop) |
| **Split Fail**| Vehicle queued through red     |

To prove green light:
- Show a **green phase bar** at your direction (e.g., Phase 2) at the exact timestamp of the crash.
- Validate against system time (ASTPM clocks are synced via NTP).

Example:
> If the crash occurred at 08:16:47 AM, and Phase 2 shows green from 08:16:30 to 08:17:00, this confirms your light was green.

---

## Step 5: Export the Data for Legal Use

- Use **Export CSV** or **PDF Snapshot** tools in the ASTPM interface
- Capture:
  - Date
  - Time
  - Phase chart for the direction of travel
- Annotate or highlight the moment of collision

**Best practice:** Take screenshots and include them in your demand letter, police report, or court filing.

## Legal Relevance

### Utah Code § 41-6a-305
> “A person may not proceed through a red signal unless specifically authorized…”

**Proof of green light** rebuts:
- Comparative fault claims
- Failure-to-yield allegations
- Insurance denials based on alleged red light running

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is ASTPM data admissible in court?**  
Yes. It is a government-generated public record. To introduce it, use Utah Rule of Evidence 902(5) or authenticate via affidavit from UDOT.

**Q: What if the intersection doesn’t show in ASTPM?**  
Contact the UDOT Traffic Operations Center (801-887-3700) or submit a GRAMA request for archived signal phase data.

**Q: What if there’s no green light bar during my crash time?**  
Verify your phase ID. You may be reading the wrong direction or a different movement (e.g., left-turn vs. through). Double-check your timestamp and direction.

**Q: How far back can I access signal data?**  
30 days typically via dashboard. Older data must be requested via [Utah’s Open Records Portal](https://openrecords.utah.gov).

## Sample Legal Use

> “According to ASTPM records retrieved from UDOT for Phase 2 (Northbound through) at the intersection of 1300 E and 2100 S, the signal was green from 08:16:30 to 08:17:00 on March 4, 2025. The collision occurred at 08:16:47, meaning my client had a green light. This directly contradicts any assertion that they failed to yield or ran a red light.”
